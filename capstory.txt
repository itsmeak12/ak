IT IS THE YEAR 1975, WHEN CHARLOTTE VON SLEDVIN, A 19-YEAR-OLD STUDENT OF A SWEDISH
ROYAL FAMILY, TRAVELS TO INDIA TO GET A PORTRAIT MADE BY A GIFTED ARTIST. THE ARTIST WAS
BORN INTO A POOR INDIAN FAMILY OF THE LOWEST CASTE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE 
“UNTOUCHABLES.” DESPITE THE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ARTIST NAMED 
PRADYUMNA KUMAR MAHANANDIA HAD GAINED AN OUTSTANDING REPUTATION FOR BEING A 
GIFTED PAINTER. HIS REPUTATION LED CHARLOTTE VON SLEDVIN TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY TO INDIA TO GET HER PORTRAIT DONE.
