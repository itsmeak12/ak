It is the YEAR 1975, when CHARLOTTE VON  SLEDVIN, a 19-year-old student of a SWEDISH
royal family, travels to INDIA to get a portrait made by a gifted artist. The artist was
born into a poor INDIAN family of the lowest caste, also known as the 
“untouchables.” Despite the incredibly difficult circumstances, the artist named 
Pradyumna Kumar Mahanandia had gained an outstanding reputation for being a 
gifted painter. His reputation led CHARLOTTE VON SLEDVIN to travel all the way to India to get her portrait done.
